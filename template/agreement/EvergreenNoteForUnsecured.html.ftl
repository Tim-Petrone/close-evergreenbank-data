          from ${thirtyDaysBeforeFirstDueDate?string["MMMM dd, yyyy"]!"-"}, calculated as described
          in
          the "INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD" paragraph using an interest rate of
          ${interestRate*100!"-"}%, until paid in full. The interest rate may change under the terms
          and
          conditions of the "INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT" section.</b>
      <br><br><b>PAYMENT. I will pay this loan in ${numOfPayments!"-"} payments of
        ${(loanPayment.monthlyPayment?string.currency)!"-"} each payment. My first payment is due
        ${paymentDueDate?string["MMMM dd, yyyy"]!"-"}, and all subsequent paymentsare due on the
        same
        day of each month after that. My final payment will be due on
        ${finalPaymentDate?string["MMMM
        dd, yyyy"]!"-"}, and will be for all principal and all accrued interest not yet paid.
        Payments
        include principal and interest. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law,
        payments
        will be applied first to any accrued unpaid interest; then to principal; and then to any
        late
        charges. I will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as
        Lender
        may designate in writing.</b>
      <br><br><b>INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD. Interest on this Note is computed on a 365/365 simple
        interest basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest
        rate over the number of days in a year (365 for all years, including leap years), multiplied
        by
        the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual
        number of days the principal balance is outstanding. All interest payable under this Note is
        computed using this method.</b>
      <br><br><b>Prepayment:</b> l may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed
      earlier
      than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender in writing, relieve me of
      my
      obligation to continue to make payments under the payment schedule. Rather, early payments
      will
      reduce the principal balance due and
      may result in my making fewer payments. I agree not to send Lender payments marked "paid
      in
      full", "without recourse", or similar language. If I send such apayment, Lender
      may
      accept it without losing any of Lender's rights under this Note, and 1 will remain
      obligated
      to pay any further amount owed to Lender. All written communications concerning disputed
      amounts,
      including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes
      "payment infull " of the amount owed or that is tendered which other conditions or
      limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to:
      Evergreen
      Bank Group, Oak Brook Office, 1515 West 22nd Street, Suite 100W, Oak Brook, IL 60523.
      <br><br><b>LATE CHARGE.</b> If a payment is 10 days or more late, I will be charged 5.000% of
      the
      unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment.
      <br><br><b>RETURN ITEM FEE.</b> If any payment under this Note is made with a check, ACH
      transfer
      or other instrument that is dishonored for any reason, Borrower agrees to pay Lender a return
      item
      fee of Twenty-Five & 00/100 Dollars ($25.00) in addition to any other amount or charges
      Borrower may owe Lender.
      <br><br><b>INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.</b> Upon maturity, whether scheduled or accelerated by
      Lender
      because of my default, the interest rate on this Note shall be
      increased by 5.000 percentage points. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the
      maximum interest rate limitations under applicable law.
      <br><br><b>DEFAULT.</b> I will be in default under this Note if any of the following happen:

        <li><b>False Statements. </b>Any representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by
          me
          or on my behalf under this Note or the related documents is false or
          misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished.</li> <br>
        <li><b>Death or Insolvency. </b>Any Borrower dies or becomes insolvent; a receiver is
          appointed

          bankruptcy
          or Insolvency laws.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>LENDER'S RIGHTS.</b> Upon default, Lender may declare the entire unpaid principal
      balance
      under this Note and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due, and then I will pay that
      amount.
      <br><br><b>ATTORNEYS' FEES; EXPENSES.</b> Lender may hire or pay someone else to help
      collect
      this Note if I do not pay. I will pay Lender that amount. This includes, subject to any limits
      under applicable law, Lender's attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses,
      whether
      or
      not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys' fees, expenses for bankruptcy proceedings
      (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), and appeals. If not
      prohibited by applicable law, I also will pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums
      provided by law.
      <br><br><b>JURY WAIVER.</b> Lender and I hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any
      action,
      proceeding, or counterclaim brought by either Lender or me against the other.
      <br><br><b>GOVERNING LAW.</b> This Note will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender
      and,
      to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of
      Illinois without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Note has been accepted by
      Lender
      in the State of Illinois.
      <br><br><b>CHOICE OF VENUE.</b> If there is a lawsuit, I agree upon Lender's request to
      submit
      to the jurisdiction of the courts of DuPage County, State of Illinois.
      <br><br><b>COLLATERAL.</b>This loan is unsecured.
      <br><br><b>ARBITRATION. I and Lender agree that all disputes, claims and controversies between
        us
        whether individual, joint, or class in nature, arising from
        this Note or otherwise, including without limitation contract and tort disputes, shall be
        arbitrated pursuant to the financial services rules of J.A.M.S. or

        to
        take or dispose of any property securing this Note shall
        constitute a waiver of this arbitration agreement or be prohibited by this arbitration
        agreement. This includes, without limitation, obtaining injunctive
        relief or a temporary restraining order; invoking a power of sale under any deed of trust or
        mortgage; obtaining a writ of attachment or imposition of a
        receiver; or exercising any rights relating to personal property, including taking or
        disposing
        of such property with or without judicial process
        pursuant Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Any disputes, claims, or controversies

        jurisdiction. The statute of limitations, estoppel, waiver, laches,
        and similar doctrines which would otherwise be applicable in an action brought by a party
        shall
        be applicable in any arbitration proceeding, and the
        commencement of an arbitration proceeding shall be deemed the commencement of an action for
        these purposes. The Federal Arbitration Act shall
