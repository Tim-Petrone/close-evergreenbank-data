        >Electronic Signature Agreement</span
      ><br />
      I am signing this Agreement electronically. I agree this electronic signature (hereafter referred to as "E-Signature") is the legal equivalent of my physical signature on this Agreement. Use of a keypad, mouse or other device to select an item, button, icon, or another similar act/action constitutes my signature acceptance and agreement as if actually signed by me in writing. No certification authority or other third party verification is necessary to validate my E-Signature, and the lack of such certification or third party verification will not in any way affect the enforceability of my E-Signature or any resulting contract. I consent to be legally bound by this Agreement's terms and conditions. I am authorized to enter into this Agreement for all persons who own or are authorized to access any of the accounts and such persons will be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
