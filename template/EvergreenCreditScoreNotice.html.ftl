        Notice To The Home Loan Applicant
        </div>
        <p>
          In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a
          consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan,
          and the key factors affecting your credit scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The credit score is a computer-generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on
          information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about
          your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist
          the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what
          interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on
          your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring
          technologies change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review
          the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may
          vary from one company to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact
          the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or
          contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer-reporting
          agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide
          you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.
